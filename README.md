# Hey it's dotfiles! 🖖🏼

> All my dotfiles with configurations. Based on [this article!](https://www.ackama.com/what-we-think/the-best-way-to-store-your-dotfiles-a-bare-git-repository-explained/)

## Get started 🏁

Clone the project

```bash
  cd ~
  git clone --bare git@github.com:teziovsky/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles
```

Define the alias in the current shell scope

```bash
  alias dotfiles='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'
  dotfiles config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
  source ~/.zshrc
```

Checkout the actual content from the git repository to your `$HOME`

```bash
  dotfiles checkout
```

> Note that if you already have some of the files you'll get an error message. You can either (1) delete them or (2) back them up somewhere else. It's up to you.

Awesome! You’re done. 🎊 🥳
